Project description
This project aims to develop a machine learning system for state prediction based on fertility data. The main steps are data pre-processing, training of the model using the random forest method and analysis of the interpretation of the model.

Tasks and deliverables
Data pre-processing:
Cleaning the dataset from outliers.
Convert categorical variables to numerical values.
Class balancing:
The SMOTE method was used to remove the imbalance between the target classes.
Model training:
RandomForestClassifier was used for the classification task.
Explanation:
Implemented interpretations of the model using SHAP library.
Visualisation of results:
Visualised the importance of features and the final interpretation results.

Stack & Libraries
Python, Pandas, Sklearn
Imbalanced-learn for working with unbalanced data
SHAP for model interpretation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation
